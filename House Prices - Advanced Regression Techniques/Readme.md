# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" Kaggle competition. The goal of this competition is to predict the final price of each home based on various features provided in the dataset.

## Files
- **Bestscore**: This file contains the best score achieved by the model on the test dataset.
- **Dataset**: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the model. The dataset can be found in both CSV format (`train.csv`, `test.csv`) and a text file (`data_description.txt`) providing descriptions of the features.
- **Notebook**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project can be found on the Kaggle competition page: [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) or in the `Dataset` directory of this repository. 

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Exploring the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.
2. **Model Selection**: Trying out various regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating models using appropriate metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning the selected model to improve performance.
5. **Prediction**: Generating predictions on the test dataset.
6. **Submission**: Preparing the submission file for Kaggle.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, tensorflow, scikit-learn
